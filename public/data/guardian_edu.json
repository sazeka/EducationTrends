      "summary": "Ministers should encourage teachers who are keen to try new things before the new curriculum’s formal adoption\nMuch better to defer a white paper on special needs education in England than to announce plans in haste, only to be forced to withdraw them. This was the calculation behind the government’s decision to put off until next year its plans for reform in a vitally important and sensitive area. Some council leaders were disappointed by the delay, such is their desperation about overspends. But ministers hope that further consultation will enable them to gather support for proposals that they insist are aimed at improving the system by making mainstream schools more inclusive – and not, as many families fear, reducing entitlements and saving money.\nThe postponement was probably prudent. But as details of last week’s Francis review on the curriculum sink in, it is clear that the government has work to do in maintaining a sense of momentum around its plans for education. The changes to GCSE content and exams set out in the report, which were mostly accepted by Bridget Phillipson, will take effect from 2029, which is after the next general election. Pupils who are currently in their last year of primary school (aged 10 and 11) will be the first to take the refreshed courses. Changes to the national curriculum will take effect a year earlier.\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For example, modernisation will always be denounced as a dilution of standards. Inevitably, Conservatives have leapt on recommendations by an independent review, commissioned by the government, as proof that Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, is “dumbing down” the curriculum.\nThe basis of these charges is that the review, led by Becky Francis, professor of education at University College London, proposes reducing the burden of GCSE exams and scrapping the English baccalaureate – a cluster of subjects that, when taken together, constitute a metric of success recognised in school league tables. Conservatives are also unhappy about the notion that primary schoolchildren should learn about the climate crisis and be encouraged to value diversity.\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
